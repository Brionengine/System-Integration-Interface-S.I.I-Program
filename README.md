# SII Quantum AI Framework - User Guide

## Overview
The System Integration Interface (SII) Quantum AI Framework is designed to autonomously integrate, configure, and optimize project components using quantum and classical resources. This framework is modular, scalable, and highly adaptable to complex systems.

## Key Components
1. **Quantum AI Core** - Manages memory, processing, and self-healing tasks using quantum algorithms.
2. **Integration Engine** - Recursively maps the project directory, dynamically loads modules, and connects components.
3. **Self-Healing System** - Monitors system health and applies fault tolerance and error correction as needed.

## Setup and Installation
1. **Requirements**:
    - Python 3.8 or higher.
    - Install necessary dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. **Setup**:
    - Unzip the package, navigate to the directory in your terminal.
    - Run the system initialization with `python -c "from integration_engine import IntegrationEngine; engine = IntegrationEngine('/path/to/project'); engine.integrate_components()"`.

## Usage Instructions
### Starting the Quantum AI Core
- The `QuantumAICore` provides primary quantum operations. These are invoked during integration by the `IntegrationEngine`.

### Component Integration
- The `IntegrationEngine` recursively maps the project structure and auto-loads components it identifies.
- Use the provided initialization command to start the integration.

### Self-Healing and Fault Tolerance
- The `SelfHealingSystem` monitors errors and invokes `QuantumAICore.auto_correct()` to apply corrections autonomously.
- You can adjust sensitivity and threshold settings in the `self_healing.py` file.

## Customization
### Directory Mapping
- Modify the `root_directory` parameter in `IntegrationEngine` to customize the root directory for recursive scanning.

Thank you for using the SII Quantum AI Framework!
